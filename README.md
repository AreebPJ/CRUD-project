* Project Management
* Databases
* Java SE
* Spring Boot
* Front-End Development
* Continuous Integration
* Cloud Fundamentals

## Requirements 
There are a minimum set of requirements that were added during the duration of the project. The requirements are: 
* A Jira board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
* Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture used for the project.
* A Risk Assessment created at the beginning of the project.
* A relational database used to store data for the project.
* A functional application created in the OOP language.
* The application must have a functioning front-end website and integrated API.
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System
* Code built through a CI server
* Application deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

## Approach 
To achieve the requirements the benchmark app consists of the following functionality.
* Create a client. Whcih stores
  * user_id
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Gender
* Create a workout. Which stores
